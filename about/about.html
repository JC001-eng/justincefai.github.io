          Iâ€™m Justin Cefai, a <b>front-end software engineer</b> with over
          <b>five years of experience</b> building dynamic, responsive websites
          and web applications.

          My expertise includes
          <b>React, TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, and SCSS</b>. I focus
          on writing clean, maintainable code while ensuring that the final
          product <b>enhances both design and user experience</b>. Does this
          sound like it was written by a bot? Cause it was.

          I like to <b>collaborate closely with design and product</b> teams to
          implement features that <b>improve user engagement</b>, increase
          conversion rates, and <b>boost overall site performance</b>. I thrive
          on delivering solutions that optimize both UI and site responsiveness.
          All of this is true and was not fabricated by ChatGPT.

          We both know you're not still reading this. I like driving my family
          nuts by quoting

          bee in 6th grade. I almost lost my left eye the year before that in a
          freak jump rope accident. My feet are two different sizes.

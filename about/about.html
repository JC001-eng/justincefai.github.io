          Justin Cefai, a front-end software engineer with over five years of
          experience building dynamic, responsive websites and web applications.

        <p>
          My expertise includes React, TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, and
          SCSS. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code while ensuring that
          the final product enhances both design and user experience.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I like to collaborate closely with design and product teams to
          implement features that improve user engagement, increase conversion
          rates, and boost overall site performance. I thrive on delivering
          solutions that optimize both UI and site responsiveness.
        </p>

          We both know you're not still reading this. I like driving my family
          nuts by quoting movies that they've never seen. I once beat a silver
          lynel in Zelda and took zero damage. I was in the local paper for
          winning a spelling bee in 6th grade. I almost lost my left eye the
          year before that in a freak jump rope accident. My feet are two
          different sizes. My bicycle is my therapist.

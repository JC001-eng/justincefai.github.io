        <p>
         <span class="large">Hello <span class="hand">ðŸ‘‹</span></span> Iâ€™m Justin Cefai, a front-end software engineer with over five
          years of experience building dynamic, responsive websites and web
          applications. I specialize in turning design mocks into pixel-perfect,
          engaging user experiences.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My expertise includes React, TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5,
          and SCSS. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code while
          ensuring that the final product enhances both design and user
          experience.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          At Goop, I collaborated closely with design and product teams to
          implement features that improved user engagement, increased conversion
          rates, and boosted overall site performance. I thrive on delivering
          solutions that optimize both UI and site responsiveness.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Outside of coding, Iâ€™m an avid cyclist, chess player, and drummer.
          When Iâ€™m not tinkering with web components or optimizing site
          performance, you can find me enjoying the outdoors or playing video
          games with my son, Levi.

      <p>Hi, I’m Justin Cefai, a front-end software engineer with over five years of experience building dynamic, responsive websites and web applications. I specialize in turning design mocks into pixel-perfect, engaging user experiences.</p>
      <br>
      <p>My expertise includes JavaScript (ES6+), React, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, and SCSS. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code while ensuring that the final product enhances both design and user experience.</p>
      <br>
      <p>At Goop, I collaborated closely with design and product teams to implement features that improved user engagement, increased conversion rates, and boosted overall site performance. I thrive on delivering solutions that optimize both UI and site responsiveness.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Outside of coding, I’m an avid cyclist, chess player, and drummer. When I’m not tinkering with web components or optimizing site performance, you can find me enjoying the outdoors or playing video games with my son, Levi.</p>
